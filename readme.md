#Onekey

This is a reasonably complete set of plans for a single key programmable USB keyboard, meant to be plugged in to a usb-c connector. You could, I don't know, replace a missing escape key.

There is no code yet, but maybe there will be? The connector I made this footprint for is [this one from mouser](http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=12401562E4%232Avirtualkey52350000virtualkey523-12401562E4%232A). The key is a Mattias Quiet key footprint, but any SPST switch will work. The PCB has to be thinner than standard, I recommend OSHPark's excellent [0.8mm service](http://docs.oshpark.com/services/two-layer-hhdc/). The single mounting hole is meant to take an M3 screw and nut, to act as support, so it's not stressing the connector or port as much.
